# JavaSE Assignment 5 requirements

## Problem description

**Develop in Java, Eclipse/IntelliJ projects in BOTH: non-OOP and OOP approaches (but without the JCL - Java Collection Framework) for the following problems - also include the pics with the logic flow:**

> 5.1. A person is tracking the gas consume of the his/her car in terms of liters and money invest per litre in every day. Find the overall consume and the average consume in both money and liters.

> 5.2. A software developer is staying a certain number of the minutes in front of the screen per day and he/she is counting them for 3 weeks. Find out the biggest and the smallest amount in minutes in front of the display and in which days happened.

> 5.3. In a students class we have m students and n assignments mark for each student. We have to find the average mark for each student and the average mark of the entire class. Extend the example to calculate the average per class and total for the entire year with minimum 5 groups/classes.

> 5.4. In a rent-car company, there are n cars and they are monitored m days in terms of the km per day. Find out the average per m days for each car. In addition find out the max and min of the km per day for each car.

> 5.5. In a parking lot with OCR cameras and access cards there are n places for the cars. In each parking place, there are parking different cars which are staying the different number of minutes. Each parking place is monitored for 5 working days. Find out the max and min time spent by the car for each place."

## Objective

**Implement business logic flow and OOP - Object Oriented Progrmming paradigms using Java class, interface, methods, arrays, for and while statements - please see Lecture 01 for start-up.**
