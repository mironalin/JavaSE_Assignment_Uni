# JavaSE Assignment 6 requirements

## Problem description

**Implement the following tasks using Java Multithreading API:**

> 7.1 Parallel addition for two large vectors - benchmark with running time on various configurations (e.g. millis consumed in 8 threads on 2 cores, 4 threads on 4 cores, etc.)

> 7.2 Parallel dot product between two large vectors - benchmark

> 7.3 Parallel addition for two large matrixes - the two input matrix are read from file stream (text file) and the output is written also in file stream (text file) + benchmark

> 7.4 Parallel addition of the items from each row of a matrix object - benchmark

> 7.5 Read a matrix CONCURRENTLY from a file with diffrent Java threads.

## Objective

**Use Java API multi-threading for concurrency and parallelism.**
